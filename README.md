# Backend Engineer Work Sample

This project skeleton contains a basic Express setup one endpoint to create a user and one endpoint to fetch all users, as well as a basic empty unit test.

## Scripts 
`npm start` starts the server

`npm test` executes the tests

## Goal
1. Adjust POST /users that it accepts a user and stores it in a database.
    * The user should have a unique id, a name, a unique email address and a creation date
2. Adjust GET /users that it returns (all) users from the database.
   * This endpoint should be able to receive a query parameter `created` which sorts users by creation date ascending or descending.

Feel free to add or change this project as you like.

# My changes
i have refactored the app to use Hexagonal/Clean Architecture
a with the idea being to demonstrate an understanding of
software design paradigms.

clean architecture attempts to break down code into different
units that do one very specific thing, keep them Modular and maintainable


# Directory Strucuture
 - Application
    - services
    - use-cases

 - Domain
    - entities
    - validation
    - repositories

 - Infrastructure
    - inbound
        - http
    - outbound
        - database



### Application layer

files in Application layer deal with data manipulation and business logic
these are services and use-cases.

in this example use-cases are the meat of the application
they gather information from different services, do transforms
and pass the data to either a user or to a service.

services are more like data transport, moving data from use-cases
to data stores or from data stores to use cases, in the form of  entities.
services can also perform some business logic but rather offload this information to
the use-cases or to entities themselves. services will most likely instantiate an entity
and cary the information in that form.

### Domain

This layer mostly deals with types in our system
here we can find our user entity or user type,
this class is responsible for defining what a user is
and what a user can do.

we also have other types here such as ports (repository) which
must be implanted by any outside source that would like to receive data
from our system.

### Infrastructure

these are outside exchangeable parts of our system, they contain no
business logic things like (databases, http servers) these can be added
or swapped out, in this example we use MongoDB and Express but we could just
as easily swap these out for postgreSQL and a hapijs server and
the rest of our business logic will not change or even need to be
refactored.

The database reading and writing is handled by mongoose via our repository,
the repository here does gets an interface from the domain layer this interface
will tell it which methods to implement(which methods the userService will call and
which data will be passed.

#### The http server
The http server in this case an expressjs server will interact with our system via
use-cases.

The server is setup in a pretty standard manner
- controllers
- routes
- middleware
- utils
- validation
- app.ts
- server.ts
- container.ts

since we are using dependency injection
we have a container class which will setup all the
instances, we also have a route factory which will take
an instance of a controller and return the routes appropriate
for this controller by looking at the instance type.

this way we can automatically inject all decencies right into the
system when we start up the server.

I actually forgot to add pagination and formatted responses ðŸ˜¬

# Example: inbound data
you create a user via REST POST /user.
The controller gathers the data describing 
your user and invokes a "create-user" use case 
in the User context. The use case, in turn, 
calls the UserService which will take the plain data
entered create a user entity this entity (an instance of
the user calls, the entity is than passed onto the repository
the repository is responsible for saving the entity to a data store.

# Exanple: outbound data
you make a request for all the users via REST GET /user
in this case the data sent via query params will mostly 
follow the same path as above but no new user is created
the user service requests the repository to make a query
the repository will return an array of MongoDB documents
these documents are than parsed by the services and converted
into actual user instances before being returned to the use case
the use-case (get-all-users) will than return to the Controller
a new array of objects by calling the User.toJSON method.

The idea is that internally in the application layer we only
work with entities, these entities encapsulate everything they need
validation, entity specific logic etc when the application needs to give data
to the outside it can simply request a safe json representation of
the entity to share via toJSON

# Setup and Docker
The app is dockerized and orchastrated with
docker-compose, a simple docker-compose up is
all you need to get started. Docker will spin up
- a mongodb container
- the application nodejs container, running alpine node 21

# Getting Started
1. setup your environment, copy the `.env.example` to a new file `.env`
2. install the dependencies `npm i`
3. run the tests `npm run test`

If you are using docker
4. build and run the containers `docker-compose up -d` or `docker-compose up` if you like logs
    - mongo container on port `27017`
    - application container on port `4111`

If you are running the app on your local machine
5. make sure your have a mongoDB running on `localhost:27017`

# Using Docker
you might need to add the project folder to shared paths from Docker -> Preferences... -> Resources -> File Sharing

If you encounter errors with bcypt you probably need to remove your local node_modules
`rm -rf node_modules/`

than run a clean build `docker-compose up --build be`
